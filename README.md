# Plant Monitor

This repository describes how to monitor health of your plants with Raspberry Pi and share your data on AWS. The solution involves:
* using the **Xiaomi Mi** plant sensor for reading soil moisture and conductivity, room temperature and light conditions,
* using **Raspberry Pi NoIR Camera Board v2** for the data acqusition,
* analyzing data stored on AWS.

The installation procedure and examples of analysis scripts are documented here https://github.com/salekd/plant_monitor_rpi/wiki
